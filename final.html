            <p class="interesting">Sloths are considered the world's slowest animal. They creep at such a slow pace that
                algae grow on their fur. Sloths sleep about 15-18 hours a day and they can turn their heads almost 360
                degrees.

            </ul>
            <p>Sloths have three toes on each rear limb. Sloths are almost helpless on the ground but are able to swim.
                Sloths have color vision but have poor visual acuity. They also have poor hearing. Thus, they rely on
                their sense of smell and touch to find food. Sloths are heterothermic, meaning their body temperature
                may vary according to the environment
